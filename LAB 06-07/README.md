# ⭐ Task 1: Check Positive, Negative, or Zero (if-else if-else)

## 🔍 Overview
This program takes an *integer* number as input from the user and checks if it is *positive, **negative, or **zero*.  
It uses the if-else if-else ladder to handle three mutually exclusive outcomes.

## 🎯 Objective
To practice using the if-else if-else structure for handling *three mutually exclusive conditions*.

## ✔️ Output
Enter an integer: -10  
The number is negative.

## ✍️ Learning Outcomes
* Use the if-else if-else ladder structure.
* Handle multi-way decision logic.
* Understand that only one block of code is executed in the ladder structure.

# ⭐ Task 2: Temperature-Based Action Suggester (if-else if-else)

## 🔍 Overview
This program suggests *actions* based on the *temperature* entered by the user, providing advice based on four distinct temperature ranges.

## 🎯 Objective
To apply the if-else if-else ladder for *range-based conditional checks*.

## ✔️ Output
Enter temperature (in C): 25  
The weather is pleasant and suitable for outdoor activities.

## ✍️ Learning Outcomes
* Implement multi-level *range checking*.
* Use conditional logic to map numerical input to textual advice.
* Understand the efficiency of if-else if-else by skipping unnecessary checks.

# ⭐ Task 3: Simple Login System Simulation (if-else if-else)

## 🔍 Overview
This program simulates a basic login system by prompting the user for a *username* and *password*, then comparing them against predefined credentials (admin, 12345).

## 🎯 Objective
To compare *string inputs* using if-else if-else to determine access rights based on multiple scenarios (Access Granted, Wrong Password, User Not Found).

## ✔️ Output
Enter username: admin  
Enter password: 1234  
Wrong Password.

## ✍️ Learning Outcomes
* Handle and compare string input.
* Implement logic for multiple distinct login failure scenarios.
* Practice combined conditions (e.g., correct username but incorrect password).

# ⭐ Task 4: University Exam Results and Scholarship Eligibility System (Challenge)

## 🔍 Overview
This program analyzes a student's marks in three subjects to calculate *total marks, **percentage, **grade* (A–F), and *scholarship eligibility* (Merit / Regular / None).  
It includes a *Failure Condition* if Grade F is scored in any subject.

## 🎯 Objective
To implement a complex, real-world application using multiple conditional structures to handle grading, failure conditions, and scholarship logic.

## ✔️ Output
Enter Subject 1 Marks: 95  
Enter Subject 2 Marks: 92  
Enter Subject 3 Marks: 96  

Total Marks: 283  
Percentage: 94.33%  

Subject 1 Grade: A  
Subject 2 Grade: A  
Subject 3 Grade: A  

Scholarship: *Merit Scholarship*

## ✍️ Learning Outcomes
* Apply multi-level decision rules for grading based on percentages.
* Implement conditional logic for complex scenarios (Failure, Merit Scholarship, Regular Scholarship).
* Structure a large program with multiple dependent checks and decision termination logic.

# ⭐ Task 5: Loan Eligibility Checker (Nested if)

## 🔍 Overview
This program checks a person's eligibility for a loan based on two criteria: *age* (≥ 18) and *annual income* (≥ $30,000).  
It uses a *nested if* structure to ensure the income check only occurs if the age requirement is met.

## 🎯 Objective
To practice using *nested if statements* where the second condition is dependent on the first condition being true.

## ✔️ Output
Enter age: 25  
Enter annual income: 45000  
Congratulations! You are eligible for a loan.

## ✍️ Learning Outcomes
* Use *nested if* logic for sequential, dependent checks.
* Implement multi-level decision-making based on multiple criteria.
* Understand the flow of control in nested conditional blocks.

# ⭐ Task 6: Role-Based Access System (Nested if & if-else if-else)

## 🔍 Overview
This program combines conditional structures:  
* A nested structure for *Authentication* (username "admin," password "password123").  
* After success, an if-else if-else ladder determines *Role-Based Access* ("Admin", "Guest", or No Access).

## 🎯 Objective
To combine *nested if* (for authentication) and the *if-else if-else* ladder (for role-based access) in one application.

## ✔️ Output
Enter username: admin  
Enter password: password123  
Enter role: Guest  
Authentication Successful!  
Limited Access

## ✍️ Learning Outcomes
* Combine different control structures (nested if and if-else if-else).
* Handle multi-step security and permission logic.
* Map string input to specific access responses based on role.

# ⭐ Task 1: Check Positive Number

## 🔍 Overview

This program takes an integer from the user and checks whether it is **positive** using only an `if` statement.

## 🎯 Objective

To practice using a simple `if` condition for one‑way decision making.

## ✔️ Output

```
Enter a number: 5
The number is positive.
```

## ✍️ Learning Outcomes

* Use simple `if` statements
* Check numeric conditions
* Display conditional messages

---

# ⭐ Task 2: Check Even Number

## 🔍 Overview

This program checks whether a given integer is **even** using only an `if` statement.

## 🎯 Objective

To understand modulus‑based even number detection.

## ✔️ Output

```
Enter a number: 8
The number is even.
```

## ✍️ Learning Outcomes

* Use `%` operator for even/odd checking
* Practice conditional execution

---

# ⭐ Task 3: Largest of Three Numbers

## 🔍 Overview

This program takes three numbers and identifies the **largest** using only multiple `if` statements.

## 🎯 Objective

To compare values using conditional logic without using else.

## ✔️ Output

```
Enter three numbers: 10 25 7
The largest number is: 25
```

## ✍️ Learning Outcomes

* Compare multiple values
* Use independent `if` conditions

# ⭐ Task 4: Grade Calculator (Using Only if)

## 🔍 Overview

This program takes marks out of 100 and assigns a **grade** using only `if` statements.

## 🎯 Objective

To practice multiple range‑based checks using separate conditions.

## ✔️ Output

```
Enter marks: 85
Grade: A
```

## ✍️ Learning Outcomes

* Understand conditional ranges
* Implement multi‑level grading logic

---

# ⭐ Task 5: Traffic Signal Simulation

## 🔍 Overview

This program simulates a traffic signal system using user input: **R**, **G**, or **Y**.

## 🎯 Objective

To map user input to meaningful traffic responses using simple `if` statements.

## ✔️ Output

```
Enter signal (R/G/Y): R
Stop
```

## ✍️ Learning Outcomes

* Handle character input
* Use conditions for decision mapping

---

# ⭐ Task 6: ATM Withdrawal (if‑else)

## 🔍 Overview

This program simulates a basic ATM withdrawal using `if‑else`.

## 🎯 Objective

To understand conditional branching between two outcomes.

## ✔️ Output

```
Enter balance: 5000
Enter withdrawal: 2000
Withdrawal successful! Remaining balance: 3000
```

## ✍️ Learning Outcomes

* Use `if‑else` statements
* Apply numeric comparison in real scenarios

---

# ⭐ Task 7: Loan Eligibility Checker

## 🔍 Overview

This program checks whether a person is eligible for a loan based on salary and experience.

## 🎯 Objective

To apply combined conditions using if‑else logic.

## ✔️ Output

```
Salary: 22000
Experience: 6
Eligible for loan
```

## ✍️ Learning Outcomes

* Combine conditions logically
* Apply real‑world decision rules

---

# ⭐ Task 8: Employee Payroll Management (Challenge)

## 🔍 Overview

This program calculates an employee’s **net salary** based on grade, years of service, bonus, tax, and gross salary.

## 🎯 Objective

To implement multi‑step salary calculation using only `if` statements.

## ✔️ Output

```
Grade: B
Years of Service: 8
Net Salary: $31,350
```

(Exact value depends on calculation)

## ✍️ Learning Outcomes

* Apply multi‑level decision rules
* Understand tax and bonus logic
* Implement structured salary computation
